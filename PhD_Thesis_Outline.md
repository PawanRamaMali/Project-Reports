**Chapter 4: Multi-Omics Foundation Models for Cancer Research**
*Group 11 - Foundation Models*

#### Problem Statement
Modern cancer research generates massive amounts of unlabeled multi-omics data (RNA-seq, miRNA, DNA methylation, CNV, histopathology). Training task-specific models from scratch for each downstream task is:
- **Data inefficient:** Requires large labeled datasets for each task
- **Computationally expensive:** Repeated training for related tasks
- **Knowledge loss:** Cannot transfer learned patterns across tasks

Develop a **foundation model** using self-supervised learning that:
1. **Pre-trains** on large unlabeled multi-omics datasets using masked autoencoding
2. **Learns** cross-modal relationships through contrastive learning
3. **Transfers** to downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning

**Chapter 5: SCALE - Extreme Model Compression for Edge Deployment**
*Group 12 - Model Compression*

#### Problem Statement
Large language models (100s of MB to GBs) cannot run on resource-constrained devices:
- **Memory limitations:** Mobile devices, edge hardware have <1GB RAM
- **Latency requirements:** Real-time medical applications need fast inference
- **Privacy concerns:** On-device processing avoids cloud transmission
- **Accessibility:** Edge deployment enables AI in low-resource settings

#### Solution Approach
Develop **SCALE framework** combining three orthogonal compression techniques:
1. **Dynamic Quantization:** INT8/INT4 quantization for 2-8× memory reduction
2. **Structured Pruning:** Channel-level pruning for 60-80% sparsity
3. **Knowledge Distillation:** Teacher-student training for accuracy retention

#### Technical Contributions

**Chapter 6: Domain Adaptation from Cell Lines to Patient Tumors**
*Group 19 - Domain Adaptation*

#### Problem Statement
Drug response prediction relies on in-vitro cell line data (GDSC, CCLE) but must generalize to in-vivo patient tumors:

**Adversarial Domain Adaptation** with gradient reversal:
1. **Feature Extractor:** Learns domain-invariant drug response features
2. **Drug Response Predictor:** Trained on labeled cell line data
3. **Domain Discriminator:** Distinguishes cell lines vs. patient tumors
4. **Gradient Reversal:** Forces feature extractor to learn domain-invariant representations

## THESIS DEFENSE STORYLINE

### Opening Statement
*"My thesis addresses a fundamental challenge in precision medicine: how do we build AI systems that are simultaneously **efficient**, **robust**, and **interpretable** enough for real-world clinical deployment? Through nine interconnected research projects, I demonstrate that this requires innovations across the entire AI pipeline—from foundation model pretraining and efficient compression, through multi-modal integration and robust learning, to explainable clinical applications."*

### Key Messages for Defense

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** "I address challenges across the entire AI lifecycle for medical applications"

2. **Clinical Validation:** "Group 17 demonstrates real-world impact with 500-patient validation, 64% treatment prediction accuracy"

3. **Production Systems:** "Two projects (Groups 12, 17) are production-ready, not just research prototypes"

4. **Novel Methodologies:** "Each project introduces novel techniques: hierarchical MIL, cross-attention fusion, self-explainability, etc."

5. **Complementary Projects:** "Projects are different yet aligned—foundation models provide pretraining for biomarker discovery; compression enables edge deployment of multi-modal models; explainability builds trust in robust predictions"

6. **Broader Impact:** "SCALE enables AI in low-resource settings; biomarker discovery ready for clinical trials; open-source frameworks benefit research community"

### Potential Committee Questions and Answers

**Q1: "How are these projects connected? Are they just a collection of separate works?"**

**A:** "They form a cohesive research program addressing the **efficiency-robustness-interpretability trilemma** in medical AI. Foundation models (Group 11) and compression (Group 12) address efficiency. Robust learning (Group 20), domain adaptation (Group 19), and missing modality handling (Group 24) address robustness. Self-explainability (Group 26) and biomarker discovery (Group 17) address interpretability. Group 23 (WSI) and Group 29 (proteins) demonstrate generalization to different data modalities."

**Q2: "What is the single biggest contribution of this thesis?"**

**A:** "The **clinical validation in Group 17**—demonstrating that multi-modal AI can achieve clinically useful accuracy (64%) on real patient data with interpretable biomarkers. This proves the entire research program's value. Second, the **production-ready SCALE framework** democratizes AI deployment for low-resource settings."

**Q3: "How does this differ from existing foundation model research (e.g., GPT, BERT)?"**

**A:** "Group 11 addresses unique challenges in medical multi-omics: (1) cross-modal contrastive learning across heterogeneous data types (RNA, DNA, images), (2) parameter-efficient fine-tuning for privacy-sensitive medical data, (3) domain-specific self-supervised objectives for cancer biology."

**Q4: "What about generalization beyond cancer?"**

**A:** "The methodologies generalize: SCALE (Group 12) works for any model. Robust learning (Group 20) applies to any imbalanced medical imaging. WSI framework (Group 23) applies to any pathology task. Protein MoE (Group 29) demonstrates generalization to non-cancer biology."
